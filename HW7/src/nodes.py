"""Computation graph node types

Nodes must implement the following methods:
__init__   - initialize node
forward    - (step 1 of backprop) retrieve output ("out") of predecessor nodes (if
             applicable), update own output ("out"), and set gradient ("d_out") to zero
backward   - (step 2 of backprop), assumes that forward pass has run before.
             Also assumes that backward has been called on all of the node's
             successor nodes, so that self.d_out contains the
             gradient of the graph output with respect to the node output.
             Backward computes summands of the derivative of graph output with
             respect to the inputs of the node, corresponding to paths through the graph
             that go from the node's input through the node to the graph's output.
             These summands are added to the input node's d_out array.
get_predecessors - return a list of the node's parents

Nodes must furthermore have a the following attributes:
node_name  - node's name (a string)
out      - node's output
d_out    - derivative of graph output w.r.t. node output

This computation graph framework was designed and implemented by
Philipp Meerkamp, Pierre Garapon, and David Rosenberg.
